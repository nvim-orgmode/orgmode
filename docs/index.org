** API docs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: api-docs
:END:
Nvim-orgmode exposes a Lua API that can be used to interact with the orgmode. To view it, check [[file:../doc/orgmode_api.txt][orgmode_api.txt]]
or do =:h OrgApi= in Neovim.

** Globals and commands
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: globals-and-commands
:END:
There are 2 additional ways to interact with Orgmode:
1. Through the =:Org= command
2. Through =Org= Lua global variable

List of available actions:
- =:Org help= - Open this documentation in new tab, set working directory to the docs folder for the tab to allow browsing
- =:Org helpgrep= - Open search agenda view that allows searching through the documentation
- =:Org agenda {type?}= - Open agenda view by the shortcut, for example =:Org agenda M= will open =tags_todo= view. When =type= is omitted, it opens up Agenda view.
- =:Org capture {type?}= - Open capture template by the shortcut, for example =:Org capture t=. When =type= is omitted, it opens up Capture prompt.
- =:Org install_treesitter_grammar= - Install the treesitter grammar for Orgmode. If installed, prompt to reinstall. Grammar is installed automatically
  on first run, but this is useful in case when there are issues with the grammar.
- =:Org store_link= - [[file:./configuration.org::#org_store_link][Store link]] to the headline under cursor. Works in both agenda and org files.
- =:Org indent_mode= - Toggle virtual indent mode in the current buffer. See [[file:./configuration.org::#org_startup_indented][osg_startup_indented]] for additional info.

All of the commands above can be executed through the global Lua =Org= variable. Examples:
- =Org.help()=
- =Org.helpgrep()=
- =Org.install_treesitter_grammar()=
- =Org.store_link()=
- =Org.indent_mode()=
- =Org.agenda()= - Opens =agenda= prompt
- =Org.agenda.m()= - Opens =tags= view
- =Org.capture()= - Opens capture prompt
- =Org.capture.t()= - Opens capture template for =t= shortcut
